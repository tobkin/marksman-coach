# Marksmanship Excellence Under Constraint: The Ranger Solution

## Problem Statement: Training Constraints
The US Army operates under resource constraints that challenge overall readiness. A single instructor is responsible for five soldiers, and they must dedicate most of their attention to safety not coaching. Furthermore, ammunition allocations are as limited as 100 rounds per soldier annually, so the Army is not reaching its full potential.

## Technical Solution: Pose Analysis Technology
Inspired by industrial ergonomic analysis systems that prevent workplace injuries, we developed a solution that transforms marksmanship training through precise motion analysis. Using Quickpose, with MediaPipe as its underlying foundation, our application captures and evaluates shooting fundamentals with unprecedented detail. 

## Maintainable and Cost-Effective
Most greenfield applications today are built using NextJS. Instead, we've chosen Streamlit for its superior LoC : Value Delivered ratio, making long-term self-maintenance a viable reality.

## Superhuman Feedback
This system provides feedback that surpasses what even dedicated one-on-one coaching can achieve, offering objective insights that human observation alone might miss. By analyzing a soldier's form frame-by-frame against standards established in the Army Service Rifle Marksmanship Guide, the application identifies subtle adjustments that can significantly enhance performance.

## Get More Training From Every Round
The solution works in both dry-fire and live-fire scenarios, allowing soldiers to refine techniques even without expending precious ammunition. Using just a smartphone camera, the system evaluates critical elements of stance, grip, and positioning that form the foundation of marksmanship excellence.

## A Foundation for Comprehensive Unit Readiness
Our proof of concept can be extended for deployment on Android devices, enabling real-time feedback by projecting analysis to a second linked device. Furthermore, the system can track detailed causal statistics on how every training round contributes to skill development, creating a comprehensive platform for unit-level readiness assessment and resource optimization.
