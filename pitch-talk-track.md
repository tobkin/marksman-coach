# Marksmanship Excellence Under Constraint: The Ranger Solution

## Problem Statement: The Marksmanship Training Problem

The US Army operates under resource constraints that challenge overall readiness. A single instructor is responsible for five soldiers, and they must dedicate most of their attention to safety not coaching. Furthermore, ammunition allocations are as limited as 100 rounds per soldier annually, so the Army is not reaching its full potential.

## Technical Solution: Pose Analysis Technology

Inspired by the Yoodli real-time speech coaching system, we developed a solution that transforms marksmanship training through precise real-time motion analysis. Using Quickpose, with the MediaPipe edge inference library as its underlying foundation, our application captures, evaluate, coaches, and aggregates insights on shooting fundamentals with unprecedented frame-by-frame specificity and inexhaustible long-term attention and patience.

## Maintainable and Cost-Effective

Most greenfield applications today are built using NextJS. Instead, we've chosen Streamlit for its superior LoC : Value Delivered ratio, making long-term self-maintenance a viable reality.

## Superhuman Feedback

After fine-tuning, the application will provide feedback that surpasses what even dedicated one-on-one coaching can achieve, offering objective insights that human observation alone might miss. By analyzing a soldier's form frame-by-frame against standards established in the Army Service Rifle Marksmanship Guide, the application identifies subtle adjustments that can significantly enhance performance.

## Get More Training From Every Round
The solution works in both dry-fire and live-fire scenarios, allowing soldiers to refine techniques even without expending precious ammunition. Using just a smartphone camera, the system evaluates critical elements of stance, grip, and positioning that form the foundation of marksmanship excellence.

## A Foundation for Comprehensive Unit Readiness
Our proof of concept can be extended for deployment on Android devices, enabling real-time feedback by projecting analysis to a second linked device. Furthermore, the system can track detailed causal statistics on how every training round contributes to skill development, creating a comprehensive platform for unit-level readiness assessment and resource optimization.
