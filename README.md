## Shot Process Overview

Based on the army rifle and carbine documents, the shot process consists of three distinct phases:

**Pre-shot phase**:
- Position
- Natural Point of Aim
- Sight Alignment/Sight Picture
- Hold

**Shot phase**:
- Refine Aim
- Breathing Control
- Trigger Control

**Post-shot phase**:
- Follow-through
- Recoil management
- Call the Shot
- Evaluate

This process forms a complete cycle for each shot taken. The functional elements that support this process include stability, aim, control, and movement â€“ all of which work together to produce accurate and precise shots.
